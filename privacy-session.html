                The Privacy Session of the Solid Symposium 2024 aims to bring together computer scientists and legal 
                experts to discuss Solid as a concrete system for data sovereignty, in order to ground the debate on 
                emergent problems from both a technical and legal perspective.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this edition, we aim to continue the discussions around technical and legal privacy aspects that 
                should be incorporated into Solid. We aim to draw from a broad interdisciplinary perspective on privacy, 
                including human-centric perspectives on privacy and the emergence of data spaces. Towards this aim, the 
                programme will be a mix of poster sessions, flash talks and presentations of short papers to present the 
                current state of research, and trajectories in privacy-related research in Solid.

                The Privacy Session of the Solid Symposium 2024 aims to bring together computer scientists and legal experts 
                to discuss Solid as a concrete system for data sovereignty, in order to ground the debate on emergent problems 
                from both a technical perspective and a legal perspective of data protection. The first edition of the Solid 
                Symposium was hosted by Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg and Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated 
                Circuits IIS, Germany, on  30-31 March 2023, and explored privacy-related problems concerning identity management, 
                authentication, and authorisation in Solid from an interdisciplinary perspective.

                In this edition, we aim to continue the discussions around technical and legal privacy aspects that should be 
                incorporated into Solid. We aim to draw from a broad interdisciplinary perspective on privacy, including human-centric 
                perspectives on privacy and the emergence of data spaces. Towards this aim, the programme will be a mix of poster 
                sessions, flash talks and presentations of short papers to present the current state of research, and trajectories 
                in privacy-related research in Solid. The interdisciplinary programme committee welcomes a broad range of methodologies 
                not limited to: mathematical and logical models that can be used to analyse threats to the Solid ecosystem, evaluated 
                proof-of-concept implementations, and methodologies drawn from the humanities, not only the legal privacy domain.

                Thus, this session comprises presentations from short papers and flash talks from posters/demos in related areas not
                limited to the following:
